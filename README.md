## Introduction

In this project, I created a simple and interactive calculator for carrying out complex and quick basic calculations using various concepts and tools that I learned about in my learning journey of TOP(The Odin Project). This is a simple and basic calculator for carrying out basic arithmetic expressions as well as some complex calculations as well. It carries out basic arithmetic operations such as that of Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction, Division as well as Percentage operation also. So feel free to use this calculator to carry out your basic calculations and share it with your friends too :)

## Features 

This project of mine contains some basic features and some advanced and complex ones too and these are as follows :-

- A backspace button to correct small mistakes
- Clear button to start new calculation
- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction, Division
- Decimal button to add decimal
- Percentage operator to carry out percentages operations
- Physical Keyboard support
- A user friendly interface and decent design too
- Relevant displays to see calculations

## Technologies and Tools

### Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Tools

- CSS variables
- Buttons
- DOM nodes
- Functions
- Event Listeners
- Conditional Statements

## Usage 

With its simple and interactive user interface, it is very easy to use and all the features and functions are clearly visible to see and use and there are no special or complex features or functionality issues which needs explanation.

## Key Concepts

Although a lot of javascript concepts are used in this and the code is pretty much self explanatory in this regard about there usage in the code, so without any detailed descriptions of these concepts, here are the key concepts used :-

- Variables 
- Conditional Statement (Ternary and Switch also)
- Functions
- Event Listeners
- DOM manipulation
- Objects

## Contributions

In this project of mine, currently I am the sole contributor and if there is anyone who faces any issues in my calculator and would like to handle them, then feel free to do so as Contributions are always welcomed.

## Learnings

Now let's come to the most important part where I conclude my project by recalling the difficulties I faced in this project and my learnings from it. As always, it was a tiring project and it took me a week to complete this project where some issues took me days to figure out but let's not waste anymore time and recall our learnings from this project :-

- Let's first talk about the new things I learned in this project. In this project, the most difficult and time-consuming problem was that of evaluating subsequent calculations and handling percentage operation which took a lot of my time due to which I had to think a lot, like a lot to solve it and that's where I learned the most. In the percentage operation, I learned that javascript has no means to handle this operation individually like other arithmetic operations due to which to handle it, we have to create a formula ourselves and this formula has to be different in the case of both first number and second number which you can look at my code. And there were other problems were there as well like setting adequate operator assignment which I had to avoid in case of second number such as previously it used to assign preceding operator as percentage in case of second number so to solve this I just removed the class operator class from percentage.

- Now let's come to the case of subsequent calculations in which case I learned that, there is no need to keep things more complicated and things can be kept simple through the use of functions even if they are simpler and smaller, use functions more and more even if the need is less, still use it and use more and more toggle flags as well.

- Now I want to conclude this by expanding on the things I learned in my previous projects and would like to say that my previous learning of handling problems by thoroughly examining the code and remembering that the issue is simple and right in front of my eyes helped me a lot, like a lot and I also would like to expand on my learning of using conditions and how I can use ternary to make conditions more small and simpler but not to use too much.

- Well, that's all for now and one thing is clear I want to do more and more problems and expand my knowledge in this amazing domain.


                          Happy Coding :)
